# JupyterHub Templates

This repository contains templates used for JupyterHub.
* `custom` contains customized templates
* `default` contains default templates by JupyterHub. By default, JupyterHub already
has these files in `/usr/local/share/jupyterhub/templates`. 
This folder does not affect the content or styling of our 
JupyterHub; they are only used as a reference.
